To whomever it may concern:
I wrote the code for the digispark85 to:
a) learn how to use the Arduino interface
b) test out my Clock/thermometer built around the digispark85

As such the project software is unfinished.
If you are curious to see how the project looks like and functions please visit my Youtube page at @TechneMoira.
You'll find the actual running design video in the Weekend Projects list (see link below).

The project code needs to be extended with a clock update function via the USB interface on the DigiSpark85 board.
There is also some experimental code targetting the interrupt(s) to see whether the clock could be set with a single STSP push-button switch.
Feel free to experiment and by all means DO SHARE your code in here but allow me to review it FIRST before publishing !

Good luck and have fun :)
